 AttributeError handles the fact that win* doesn't implement
 os.getlogin()
 Patch by yaleman

 https://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=217
 As described at https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/trends,
 GET trends (corresponding to Api.GetTrendsCurrent) is now
 deprecated in favor of GET trends/:woeid. GET trends also now
 requires authentication, while trends/:woeid doesn't.
 Patch and excellent description by jessica.mckellar

 https://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=218
 Currently, two Trends containing the same information
 (name, query, and timestamp) aren't considered equal because
 __eq__ isn't overridden, like it is for Status, User, and the
 other Twitter objects.

 https://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=206
 All variations on a theme - basically Twitter is returning
 something different for an error payload.  Changed code to
 check for both 'error' and 'errors'.

2011-05-08

 https://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=184
 A comment in this issue made me realize that the parameter sanity
 check for max_id was missing in GetMentions() - added

 First pass at working in some of the cursor support that has been
 in the Twitter API but we haven't made full use of - still working
 out the small issues.

 Imported work by Colin Howe that he did to get the tests working.

 Small tweaks post-patch

 Issue 163
 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=163
 Patch by yaemog which adds users/lookup support.
 Small tweaks to docstring only post-patch.

 Changed username/password parameter to Api class to be
 consumer_key/consumer_secret to better match the new
 oAuth only world that Twitter has demanded.

 Added debugHTTP to the parameter list to Api class to
 control if/when the urllib debug output is displayed.

2010-08-25

 First pass at adding list support.
 Added a new List class and also added to the Api class
 new methods for working with lists:

   CreateList(self, user, name, mode=None, description=None)
   DestroyList(self, user, id)
   CreateSubscription(self, owner, list)
   DestroySubscription(self, owner, list)
   GetSubscriptions(self, user, cursor=-1)
   GetLists(self, user, cursor=-1)

2010-08-24

 Fixed introduced bug in the Destroy* and Create* API calls
 where any of the routines were passing in an empty dict for
 POST data.  Before the oAuth change that was enough to tell
 _FetchUrl() to use POST instead of GET but now a non-empty
 dict is required.

 Issue 144
 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=144
 GetFriends() where it was failing with a 'unicode object has
 no attribute get'. This was caused when Twitter changed how
 they return the JSON data. It used to be a straight list but
 now there are some elements *and* then the list.

2010-08-18

 Applied the json/simplejson part of the patch found
 in Issue 64 (http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=64)
 Patch provided by Thomas Bohmbach

 Applied patch provided by liris.pp in Issue 147
 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=147
 Ensures that during a PostStatus we count the length using a unicode aware
 len() routine.  Tweaked patch slightly to take into account that the
 twitter.Api() instance may have been setup with None for input_encoding.

2010-08-17

 Fixed error in the POST path for _FetchUrl() where by
 I show to the world that yes, I do make last minute
 changes and completely forget to test them :(
 Thanks to Peter Sanchez for finding and pointing to
 working code that showed the fix

2010-08-15

 Added more help text (I hope it helps) to the README
 and also to get_access_token.py.

 Added doctext notes to twitter.Api() parameter list
 to explain more about oAuth.

 Added import exception handling for parse_qs() and
 parse_qsl() as it seems those funcitons moved between
 2.5 and 2.6 so the oAuth update broke the lib under
 python2.5.  Thanks to Rich for the bug find (sorry
 it had to be found the hard way!)

 from changeset 184:60315000989c by DeWitt
 Update the generated twitter.py docs to match the trunk

2010-08-14

 Fixed silly typo in _FetchUrl() when doing a POST
 Thanks to Peter Sanchez for the find and fix!

 Added some really basic text to the get_access_token.py
 startup output that explains why, for now, you need to
 visit Twitter and get an Application key/secret to use
 this library

2010-08-12

 Updated code to use python-oauth2 library for authentication.
 Twitter has set a deadline, 2010-08-16 as of this change, for
 the switch from Basic to oAuth.

 The oAuth integration was inspired by the work done by
 Hameedullah Khan and others.

 The change to using python-oauth2 library was done purely to
 align python-twitter with an oauth library that was maintained
 and had tests to try and minimize grief moving forward.

 Slipped into GetFriendsTimeline() a new parameter, retweets, to
 allow the call to pull from the "friends_timeline" or the
 "home_timeline".

 Fixed some typos and white-space issues and also updated the
 README to point to the new Twitter Dev site.

2010-08-02

 Updated copyright information.

 Applied changeset from nicdumz repo nicdumz-cleaner-python-twitter
   r=3c05b8ebe59eca226d9eaef2760cecca9d50944a
   tests: add .info() method to objects returned by our Mockup handler
   This is required to completely mimick urllib, and have successful
   response.headers attribute accesses.

 Applied partial patch for Issue 113
 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=113

   The partial bit means we changed the parameter from "page" to "cursor"
   so the call would work.  What was left out was a more direct way
   to return the cursor value *after* the call and also in the patch
   they also changed the method to return an iterator.

2010-05-17

 Issue 50 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=50
 Applied patch by wheaties.box that implements a new method to return
 the Rate Limit Status and also adds the new method MaximumHitFrequency

 Issue 60 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=60
 Pulled out new GetFavorites and GetMentions methods from the patch
 submitted by joegermuska

 Issue 62 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=62
 Applied patch from lukev123 that adds gzip compression to the GET
 requests sent to Twitter. The patch was modified to default gzip to
 False and to allow the twitter.API class instantiation to set the
 value to True.  This was done to not change current default
 behaviour radically.

 Issue 80 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=80
 Fixed PostUpdate() call example in the README

2010-05-16

 Issue 19 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=19
 TinyURL example and the idea for this comes from a bug filed by
 acolorado with patch provided by ghills.

 Issue 37 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=37
 Added base_url to the twitter.API class init call to allow the user
 to override the default https://twitter.com base.  Since Twitter now
 supports https for all calls I (bear) changed the patch to default to
 https instead of http.
 Original issue by kotecha.ravi, patch by wiennat and with implementation
 tweaks by bear.
