# Python Twitter

**A Python wrapper around the Twitter API.**

Author: The Python-Twitter Developers <python-twitter@googlegroups.com>

## Introduction

This library provides a pure Python interface for the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/). It works with Python versions from 2.5 to 2.7. Python 3 support is under development.

[Twitter](http://twitter.com) provides a service that allows people to connect via the web, IM, and SMS. Twitter exposes a [web services API](http://dev.twitter.com/doc) and this library is intended to make it even easier for Python programmers to use.

## Building

From source:

Install the dependencies:

- [SimpleJson](http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/simplejson)
- [Requests OAuthlib](https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
- [HTTPLib2](http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/)

This branch is currently in development to replace the HTTPLib2 libaray with the following:

- [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)

Alternatively use `pip`:
 
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Download the latest `python-twitter` library from: http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/

Extract the source distribution and run:

```
$ python setup.py build
$ python setup.py install
```

*Testing*

With setuptools installed:

```
$ python setup.py test
```

Without setuptools installed:

```
$ python twitter_test.py
```

## Getting the code

The code is hosted at [Github](https://github.com/bear/python-twitter).

Check out the latest development version anonymously with:

```
 $ git clone git://github.com/bear/python-twitter.git
 $ cd python-twitter
```

## Using

The library provides a Python wrapper around the Twitter API and the Twitter data model.

**Model:**

The three model classes are `twitter.Status`, `twitter.User`, and `twitter.DirectMessage`. The API methods return instances of these classes.

To read the full API for `twitter.Status`, `twitter.User`, or `twitter.DirectMessage`, run:

```
$ pydoc twitter.Status
$ pydoc twitter.User
$ pydoc twitter.DirectMessage
```

*API:*

The API is exposed via the `twitter.Api` class.

To create an instance of the `twitter.Api` class:

```
>>> import twitter
>>> api = twitter.Api()
```

To create an instance of the `twitter.Api` with login credentials (many API calls required the client to be authenticated.)

The python-twitter library now only supports oAuth authentication as the Twitter devs have indicated that OAuth is the only method that will be supported moving forward.

```
>>> api = twitter.Api(consumer_key='consumer_key',
                      consumer_secret='consumer_secret',
                      access_token_key='access_token',
                      access_token_secret='access_token_secret')
```

To see if your credentials are successful:

```
>>> print api.VerifyCredentials()
{"id": 16133, "location": "Philadelphia", "name": "bear"}
```

**NOTE -** much more than the small sample given here will print

To fetch a single user's public status messages, where `user` is either
a Twitter *short name* or their user id.

```
>>> statuses = api.GetUserTimeline(user)
>>> print [s.text for s in statuses]
```

To fetch a list a user's friends (requires authentication):

```
>>> users = api.GetFriends()
>>> print [u.name for u in users]
```

To post a Twitter status message (requires authentication):

```
>>> status = api.PostUpdate('I love python-twitter!')
>>> print status.text
I love python-twitter!
```

There are many more API methods, to read the full API documentation:

```
$ pydoc twitter.Api
```

## Todo

Patches and bug reports are [welcome](https://github.com/bear/python-twitter/issues/new), just please keep the style consistent with the original source.

Add more example scripts.

The twitter.Status and `twitter.User` classes are going to be hard to keep in sync with the API if the API changes. More of the code could probably be written with introspection.

Statement coverage of `twitter_test` is only about 80% of twitter.py.

The `twitter.Status` and `twitter.User` classes could perform more validation on the property setters.
