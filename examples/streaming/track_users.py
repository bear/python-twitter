# This file demonstrates how to track mentions of a specific set of users in 
# english language and archive those mentions to a local file. The output
# file will contain one JSON string per line per Tweet.

# To use this example, replace the W/X/Y/Zs with your keys obtained from
# Twitter, or uncomment the lines for getting an environment variable. If you
# are using a virtualenv on Linux, you can set environment variables in the
# ~/VIRTUALENVDIR/bin/activate script.

# If you need assistance with obtaining keys from Twitter, see the instructions
# in doc/getting_started.rst.

import os
import json

from twitter import Api

# Either specify a set of keys here or use os.getenv('CONSUMER_KEY') style
# assignment:

CONSUMER_KEY = 'WWWWWWWW'
# CONSUMER_KEY = os.getenv("CONSUMER_KEY", None)
CONSUMER_SECRET = 'XXXXXXXX'
# CONSUMER_SECRET = os.getenv("CONSUMER_SECRET", None)
ACCESS_TOKEN = 'YYYYYYYY'
# ACCESS_TOKEN = os.getenv("ACCESS_TOKEN", None)
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = 'ZZZZZZZZ'
# ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = os.getenv("ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET", None)

# Users to watch for should be a list. This will be joined by Twitter and the
# data returned will be for any tweet mentioning:
# @twitter *OR* @twitterapi *OR* @support.
USERS = ['@twitter',
         '@twitterapi',
         '@support']

# Languages to filter tweets by is a list. This will be joined by Twitter
# to return data mentioning tweets only in the english language.
LANGUAGES = ['en']

# Since we're going to be using a streaming endpoint, there is no need to worry
# about rate limits.
